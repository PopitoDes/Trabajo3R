This contribution reinforces the findings of increasing literature on post-transition Chile that reveals growing collusion between the mainstream left-wing and right-wing coalitions, which have increasing difficulties channelling demands emanating from below and therefore providing adequate political representation.},

Spatial access to recreational facilities and perceptions of the neighborhood environment and physical activity levels were examined by the socioeconomic status of area of residence (SES).   Methods.  A cross-sectional survey of adults (18--59 years) ( n  = 1,803) stratified by SES using a geographic-based index was conducted.   Results.  Respondents in low SES areas had superior spatial access to many recreational facilities, but were less likely to use them compared with those living in high SES areas. They were more likely to perceive that they had access to sidewalks and shops, but also perceived that their neighborhood was busier with traffic, less attractive, and less supportive of walking. After adjustment, respondents living in low SES areas were 36\% less likely to undertake vigorous activity. While they were more likely to walk for transport, this was not statistically significant (OR, 1.27; 95\% CI, 0.98--1.64), nor were other SES differences in walking for recreation and walking as recommended. Modifiable environmental factors were associated with walking and vigorous activity, especially perceived access to sidewalks and neighborhood attractiveness. Spatial access to attractive, public open space was associated with walking.   Conclusions.  Creating supportive environments---particularly sidewalks in attractive neighborhoods---has the potential to increase walking and vigorous activity.},

While the former was an absolutely unexpected phenomenon that forced an important turn in the country's political agenda, the result of latter was foreseeable yet surprising. In fact, the plebiscite was likely to end in a triumph of the option in favour of constitutional change, but the forcefulness of the result was surprising. In this article we look at both milestones in detail. On the one hand, we examine how the government in particular, and the political system in general, reacted to the emergence and development of the pandemic. On the other hand, based on a representative face-to-face survey of the population - which was carried out just after the plebiscite - we empirically show that the ``Reject'' vote is largely explained by the factors used in comparative studies to predict support for populist radical right (PRR) forces, while the ``Approve'' vote is characterized by high heterogeneity in ideological and sociological terms. In summary, the evidence presented here reinforces previous findings that show an increase in tensions within the centre-right bloc and, in turn, suggests that in Chile the conditions are ripe for the establishment of a populist radical right force.},

It illustrates the practical power of this ideology by describing populist movements of the modern era---European right-wing parties, left-wing presidents in Latin America, and the Tea Party movement in the United States---and charismatic populist leaders such as Juan Domingo P{\'e}ron, H. Ross Perot, Silvio Berlusconi, and Hugo Ch{\'a}vez. Although populism is ultimately part of democracy, populist forces constitute an increasing challenge to democratic politics.},

This is certainly a welcome development, but two shortcomings can be observed in the contemporary debate. On one hand, new populism scholars often start from scratch and do not build upon the existing research. On the other hand, those who have been doing comparative research on populism stay in their comfort zone and thus do not try to link their work to other academic fields. In this article, we address these two shortcomings by discussing some of the advantages of the so-called ideational approach to the comparative study of populism and by pointing out four avenues of future research, which are closely related to some of the contributions of this special issue, namely, (a) economic anxiety, (b) cultural backlash, (c) the tension between responsiveness and responsibility, and (d) (negative) partisanship and polarization.},

Yet populist actors do not operate in a cultural or ideological vacuum. So perhaps it is the national culture and broader ideology used by populists that determine their gender position. To explore this argument, we compare prototypical cases of contemporary populist forces in two regions: the Dutch Partij voor de Vrijheid (PVV, Party for Freedom) and the Dansk Folkeparti (DF, Danish People's Party) in Northern Europe, and the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela (PSUV, United Socialist Party of Venezuela) and the Bolivian Movimiento al Socialismo (MAS, Movement for Socialism) in South America.

In this article I argue that it is more fruitful to categorize populism as an ambivalence that, depending on the case, may constitute a threat to or a corrective for democracy. Unfolding my argument, I offer a roadmap for the understanding of the diverse and usually conflicting approaches to studying the relation between populism and democracy. In particular, three main approaches are identified and discussed: the liberal, the radical and the minimal. I stress that the latter is the most promising of them for the study of the ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy. In fact, the minimal approach does not imply a specific concept of democracy, and facilitates the undertaking of cross-regional comparisons. This helps to recognize that populism interacts differently with the two dimensions of democracy that Robert Dahl distinguished: while populism might well represent a democratic corrective in terms of inclusiveness, it also might become a democratic threat concerning public contestation.},

  abstract = {Die Geschichte der lateinamerikanischen Sozialwissenschaft ist eine Geschichte der Diskontinuitat. Neue Generationen von Intellektuellen zeigen den vorigen Generationen permanent die ,,kalte Schulter``, so dass sich kaum ein wissenschaftlicher Zusammenhalt entwickeln kann. Der Generationenbruch ereignet sich ohne explizit geauserte Kritik, sondern vielmehr durch die Ausblendung von bedeutenden Autoren und die Einfuhrung neuer Betrachtungsweisen. Die neu entstandenen Theorien zeigen kaum Verknupfungen mit den vorigen; allenfalls im Sinne einer Abgrenzung. Deswegen erregen die heuristischen Gebilde aus anderen Orten der Welt schnell Aufmerksamkeit, wahrend die eigene Gedankentradition als entbehrlich oder als fehlerhaft stigmatisiert wird. Es ist kein Zufall, dass in Lateinamerika Autoren wie Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Jose Medina Echeverria oder Gino Germani heute kaum noch Beachtung geschenkt wird. Ein gutes Beispiel dieser Diskontinuitat in der lateinamerikanischen Sozialwissenschaft ist der Lebenszyklus der dependencia-Schule: Wahrend sie in den 1970er Jahren von einem grosen Teil der Welt als ein erfolgreiches theoretisches Modell angesehen wurde, findet ihr Gedankengut seit den 1980er Jahren unter Sozialwissenschaftlern nur noch geringes Interesse. Da in den 1980er Jahren unter den Intellektuellen Lateinamerikas praktisch kein kritischer Diskurs uber dependencia stattfand, wurde auch die abhangige Situation, in der sich der Kontinent bis heute befindet, kaum thematisiert. Bis zum heutigen Tag fehlen neuere Analysen zu diesem Thema. Selbstverstandlich gibt es theoretische Grunde -- wie zum Beispiel das Scheitern der grosen Theorie (Boeckh 1992; Booth 1985; Menzel 1992; Murle 1997; Sklair 1988) -- die den Niedergang der dependencia-Schule erklaren; aber bis jetzt wurde das Hauptelement fur dieses ,,Vergessen`` innerhalb Lateinamerikas nicht erfasst: die permanente Diskontinuitat in der Sozialwissenschaft des Kontinents, die diese seit ihrer Entstehung auszeichnet. Es sieht so aus, als ware in Lateinamerika die Begeisterung fur neue Theorien stets groser als das Interesse an Nachforschungen uber die Vergangenheit. Besitzen die Interpretationen aus den 1960er und 1970er Jahren kein Erklarungspotential fur die heutige Zeit mehr? Haben die Gedanken der lateinamerikanischen dependencia-Schule tatsachlich keinen Gehalt mehr fur die Erklarung neuer Phanomene? Konnten ihre Ideen nicht eventuell doch eine Leistung fur das Verstandnis der Gegenwart erbringen?P Die heutige Zeit ist besonders geeignet, um derartige Fragestellungen aufzugreifen, da die Globalisierung eine epochale Transformation verkorpert, welche die Konstruktion von neuen Begriffen und Theorien erfordert (Beck 2000; Therborn 2000a). Zweifelsohne kann man heute eine Reihe von Faktoren erkennen, die auf eine wachsende Grenzen uberschreitende Vernetzung bestimmter Felder der Gesellschaft hindeuten, so dass sich eine umfangreiche Debatte uber die Auswirkungen des Globalisierungsprozesses auf die verschiedenen Nationalstaaten entwickelt hat. Es ist eine Aufgabe der Sozialwissenschaft, die Verstandigung uber diese epochale Transformation zu ermoglichen -- eine Aufgabe die in Lateinamerika zwar gerade erst virulent geworden ist, die aber zunehmend an Aktualitat gewinnt. Aus dieser Perspektive eroffnet die Globalisierung eine Chance, die Diskontinuitat innerhalb der Sozialwissenschaft des Kontinents zu uberwinden, da -- wie sich zeigen wird -- durch eine Auseinandersetzung mit den fruheren heuristischen Gebilden wichtige Gesichtspunkte fur die Interpretation des sich entwickelnden Zeitalters gewonnen werden konnen. Gerade die dependencia-Schule verkorpert eine Gedankentradition des Kontinents, die gut geeignet ist, um Beitrage fur die Interpretation der neuen Epoche zu leisten. In diesem Sinne werden in der vorliegenden Arbeit zwei zentrale Thesen behandelt. Einerseits kann man durch die Betrachtung des Lebenszyklus der dependencia-Schule die geschichtliche Diskontinuitat innerhalb der lateinamerikanischen Sozialwissenschaft sehr deutlich aufzeigen. Andererseits kann man wichtige Aspekte der gegenwartigen epochalen Transformation durch die Globalisierung dank bestimmter Elemente der Theorie der dependencia-Schule besser verstehen. Auf diese Weise lasst sich zeigen, dass gerade heute eine Moglichkeit besteht, die Diskontinuitat in der lateinamerikanischen Sozialwissenschaft zu uberwinden. Da sich diese Arbeit mit den zwei schon benannten Thesen beschaftigt, ist sie dementsprechend auch in zwei korrespondierende Grosabschnitte gegliedert.},

  abstract = {Der Elitebegriff hat besonders in den letzten Jahren Konjunktur und gewinnt fortlaufend an Brisanz. Allerdings fehlt seinem Gebrauch meist die notige Trennscharfe: Haufig signalisiert er zum einen die Suche nach leistungsstarken gesellschaftlichen Fuhrungskraften, zum  anderen druckt er Emporung uber die >>Unfahigkeit<< der politischen Klasse aus. Jenseits dieses Phanomens stellt sich die Frage nach dem theoretischen Gehalt des Elitebegriffes. Inwiefern ist er relevant fur die politische Theorie? Worin liegt sein analytisches Potential?  Die Antwort dieses Buches lautet: In der historisch vergleichenden Forschung, die den Kampf um gesellschaftliche Fuhrung zwischen Eliten in den Mittelpunkt der Analyse ruckt. Denn erst so lassen sich nationale Entwicklungspfade rekonstruieren, anhand derer sich  Konflikte zwischen Eliten und die Austragung dieser Konflikte herauskristallisieren. Aus diesem Blickwinkel mussen Bildung und Erneuerung der Eliten als Prozesse von langer Dauer verstanden werden, die entscheidend fur die historische Entwicklung aller Gesellschaften sind.  Auf Grundlage dieser theoretischen Diskussion untersucht das Buch die Geschichte Lateinamerikas von der politischen Emanzipation von Europa bis zum okonomischen Zusammenbruch von 1982. Dabei stehen Argentinien, Brasilien, Chile und Mexiko im Fokus, so dass vier Lander im Detail vergleichend untersucht werden. Der Autor lenkt den Blick auf die Frage, inwiefern gemeinsame Probleme - etwa die politische Unabhangigkeit von Europa, die Formierung des Staates oder der Umgang mit der sozialen Frage - von den jeweiligen Eliten eines Landes unterschiedlich wahrgenommen und gelost worden sind. Im Gegensatz zu europaischen Diskursen, die Lateinamerika vielfach romantisieren (andauernde Aufstande und Aufstieg charismatischer Fuhrer) oder degradieren (permanente Korruption und Unterentwicklung), bietet dieses Buch eine nuchterne Darstellung dieser komplexen Region. Statt sie zu exotisieren, wird demonstriert, dass sich aus dem Kampf zwischen den jeweiligen Eliten wesentliche Weichenstellungen ergeben haben, anhand derer sich historische Entwicklungspfade rekonstruieren lassen.},

Many intellectuals are asking themselves whether the Occupy Wall Street and Tea Party movements in the U.S. or the indignados in Spain are examples of populist uprisings. Answering this question is not straightforward, since there is an ongoing debate about how to define populism and study its impact on democracy. This article sheds light on this discussion by undertaking a critical revision of the Latin American debate on populism. Two key arguments are developed. First, populism should be conceived of as a set of ideas characterized by a moral understanding of the world, according to which the people form a homogenous and virtuous community, and the elite a pathological entity. Second, populism is not necessarily an authoritarian force, but rather an ideology that takes for granted the existence of a unified popular will, and that is at odds with deliberative and liberal conceptions of democracy.},

Political elites have thus displayed both circulation and continuity, albeit in degrees that have varied between countries and within them over time. Because the welfare of Latin American societies has always depended heavily on extracting and exporting natural resources, elite groups and factions have battled each other for control of this extraction and export and the largesse flowing from it. In a word, the economic basis of Latin American countries has fostered rent-seeking elites, an observation that remains relevant.},

Allegedly, one of the few commonalities between all the different manifestations of populism is the existence of a charismatic and strong leader, who is able to mobilize the masses and control the political organization behind him. In this chapter we have argued instead that this type of leadership is not a defining attribute of populism. We defined populism as an ideology or worldview, which assumes that society is characterized by a Manichean division between `the pure people' and `the corrupt elite.' This means that populism is not always constructed from above, i.e. by a powerful leader; many societies count a significant number of people who believe in the populist set of ideas, irrespective of the presence of a populist leader. In fact, populism exists with various types of leadership and can even be leaderless. In short, the link between political leadership and populism is much more complicated as much of the literature suggests and deserves more careful attention.},

He illustrates his argument with examples across three continents, charting the rise of anti-immigration radical Right parties in Western Europe in the aftermath of 9/11, the anti-democratic constitution-making of Latin American leftist leaders such as Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, and the influence of the Tea Party in the US following President Obama's succession of George W.

Conceived in this way, there is no straightforward relationship between populism and the welfare state. In this contribution we explore this relationship in detail. In the first part of our contribution we explain that, at a theoretical level, populism is prone to putting the welfare state under stress. Given that populist forces seek to (re)define who belongs to the political community, they challenge the existing interpretations about who should have social rights and who should pay for them. However, as we will argue in the second part of this contribution, populism practically never arises in its pure form, since it usually appears attached to other ideologies, which are crucial for developing political projects that are attractive to larger sections of the electorate. This is why, then, we focus on analysing two paradigmatic instances of populism in the contemporary world {\^a}{\texteuro}`` inclusionary populism and exclusionary populism {\^a}{\texteuro}`` in order to show the different approaches towards the welfare state that each of these subtypes of populism tend to support. Finally, we close our contribution by advancing some ideas about the future of the welfare state, which is under threat not only because of austerity and welfare retrenchment, but also due to the rise of populist forces of different kinds that seek to transform existing democratic institutions and procedures},

However, current research has not yet analyzed in detail the characteristics of those individuals with populist proclivities, or so-called  populist citizens . To address this research gap, we harmonize survey data on populist attitudes for nine European countries, five Latin American countries, and Turkey in order to uncover shared or distinct features of populist citizens. Our findings are threefold. First, we identify differences in the sociodemographic characteristics of populist citizens, notably between Europe and Latin America. Second, we find similar patterns of heterogeneity in the political features of populist citizens. Third, we show that populist citizens across all countries have the same democratic profile. They systematically support democracy over other forms of government, while being dissatisfied with its implementation. This suggests populist attitudes are intrinsic to the political culture of contemporary democracies.},

  abstract = {type="main"{$>$} From Hugo Chavez in Venezuela to Geert Wilders in the Netherlands and Sarah Palin in the US, populist leaders claim to offer more power to `the people'. However, most scholars argue that populism is in fact a democratic pathology, because it seeks to build a political system devoid of the rule of law. While it is true that populism maintains an ambivalent relationship with liberal democracy, little attention has been paid to the legitimacy of the questions raised by populist forces. Drawing on the work of Robert Dahl, I argue that current manifestations of populism are offering specific responses to two dilemmas that do not have a clear democratic solution: the boundary problem (how to define the people?) and the limits of self-government (how to control the controllers?). My article shows that populist forces are posing legitimate questions about the current state of democracy in Europe and the Americas, although their solutions tend to be more controversial than helpful.},

The concept of populism has been used to refer to such a variety of phenomena, that it is more than problematical for undertaking comparative analysis. In this paper I discuss different methodological approaches to define populism and I argue that a minimal concept of populism is the most fruitful approach to develop a comparative research agenda. To show this, I compare the minimal definitions developed by Kurt Weyland (populism as a political strategy) and Cas Mudde (populism as a thin-centered ideology). Moreover, I explain why Mudde's definition should be the starting point for a comparative research agenda on populism. To conclude, I show that this minimal definition is helpful for analyzing the ambivalent relationship between populism and democracy.},

  abstract = {While populism is a hotly debated topic around the world, most scholarship suffers from conceptual confusion and regional singularity. This paper compares European and Latin American populism, on the basis of a clear minimum definition, along three dimensions that dominate the scholarly literature on the topic: 1) economy vs. identity; 2) left-wing vs. rightwing; and 3) inclusion vs. exclusion. Empirically, our particular focus is on four prototypical cases of the predominant type of populism in these regions in the 1990--2010 period: Jorg Haider and the Freitheitliche Partei Osterreichs (Austrian Freedom Party, FPO) and Jean-Marie Le Pen of the French Front National (National Front, FN) in Europe, and Bolivian President Evo Morales and his Movimiento al Socialismo (Movement for Socialism, MAS) and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and his Movimiento V [Quinta] Republica (Fifth Republic Movement, MVR) in Latin America. While our findings confirm some generally held beliefs, they also challenge and clarify some others. Among the more notable conclusions are: 1) populism in Latin America is more ethnic than populism in Europe; 2) the difference between ``right-wing'' populists in Europe and ``left-wing'' populists in Latin American is mainly a consequence of their affiliated ideologies, not their populism; 3) in material, political, and symbolic terms European populism is primarily exclusionary, while Latin American populism is predominantly inclusionary; and 4) populism is more important in Latin America than in Europe in electoral, political, and ideological terms.},

Aim: To study the relationship between territorial socioeconomic segregation and adult mortality in the Metropolitan area of Santiago de Chile. Material and methods: Data from the 34 districts of Metropolitan Santiago were analyzed. Adjusted community mortality rates, during 2000, among adults aged 20 years or more, including specific rates per sex and age group, were analyzed. Results: There was a negative correlation between income and mortality, specially among men (rS -0.42 p {$<$}0.005). The highest correlation coefficient was observed among subjects aged 45-64 years old (rS -0.42 p {$<$}0.005). There was a high degree of inequality in mortality among males aged 20-44 years old (Gini 0.54) and in the age group 45-64 years old in both sexes (Gini 0.50). Mortality rates decreased along with increasing incomes in both sexes. 20/20 ratio shows the higher values for mortality of men aged 20-44 years (20/20 ratio 1.7 95\% CI 1.4-2.0), followed by mortality of men aged 45-64 years. Conclusions: There is a relationship between economic segregation (expressed by income) and mortality. The higher mortality rates are observed in districts of Metropolitan Santiago with the lower income (Rev Med Chile 2004; 132: 453-60)},

  abstract = {Abstract   Background : Social participation contributes to better health and has been regarded as an important component of quality of life. Despite its importance, social participation significantly decreases as age advances. Social participation may vary by sex and age and, consequently, may have different influences on health by age and sex. Few studies have examined how sex and age affect individual health status in this regard.   Objectives : This paper focuses on whether the association between self-rated health and social participation differs between men and women, and among age groups.   Design : The study was based on cross-sectional analysis of data from the 2003 Social Statistics Survey.   Settings : This survey was conducted in South Korea.   Participants : The survey respondents were 59,202 Koreans aged 25 and over. The sample population comprised each household member of 33,000 sample households who were selected by multistage probability sampling of household registries based on geographic area, sex and age group.   Methods : Face-to-face interviews were nationally conducted. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to examine factors that associated social participation with self-rated health, and the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) were presented, together with their 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). The model included various individual socioeconomic characteristics, health behaviors, and morbidity variables, such as marital status, education level, housing tenure, employment status, smoking status, alcohol intake, number of restricted activity days, and bed days.   Results : For both sexes, self-rated good health was strongly associated with social participation levels in all age groups. The influence of social participation increased as age advanced. Particularly among elderly women, those who had participated in more than two activities had more than twice the odds of self-rated good health of those who did not participate in any activities.   Conclusions : Social participation significantly decreases as people age, however, the influence of social participation on health status increases with age. This study has shown that social participation, which is an individual psychological resource, is important for health in all age groups, notwithstanding that the effect of social participation differs by age and sex. Social participation should be a basic consideration in the field of community nursing intervention, especially for the elderly and women's health promotion. Promoting social participation by individuals may lead to better health, and may therefore be an effective strategy for enhancing health.},

Environmental justice is about intragenerational distribution, not forgetting intergenerational distribution.

Departing from the income approach which measures poverty by aggregating shortfalls of incomes from a pre-determined poverty-line income, a multidimensional index is a numerical representation of shortfalls of basic needs from some pre-specified minimum levels. The class of subgroup consistent poverty indices introduced by Foster and Shorrocks (1991) is generalized to the multidimensional context. New concepts necessary for the design of distribution-sensitive multidimensional poverty measures are introduced. Specific classes of subgroup consistent multidimensional poverty measures are derived based on sets of reasonable axioms. This paper also highlights the fact that domain restrictions may have a critical role in the design of multidimensional indices.},

Therefore, the success of populist actors can be interpreted as something deriving from the distaste of the other political options, and in particular from the anger of certain sectors of the electorate with mainstream parties. Rovira Kaltwasser concludes by analysing the situation in Chile, a country that since 2019 has seen the rise of massive protests against the establishment and the claim the people should have the right to re-found the social contract, explaining why actors who promote populist ideas -- including Jos{\'e} Antonio Kast -- have not been particularly successful so far.},

We explain the case selection of this special issue and summarize the main findings of the eight case studies, which show that the pandemic did not severely damage the PRR and that they had very different responses to the challenge.

We test this theory through a comparison of recent voting in Chile and Greece, two countries where the contexts for activating populist attitudes are very different. We find that despite similar levels of populist attitudes across both countries, these attitudes explain much more of the vote in Greece than they do in Chile, and that in both countries they interact with ideological positions in predictable ways.},

One of the most important payoffs of this comparative work is conceptual. Rather than defining populism in structuralist, economic, or political-strategic terms, a growing number of scholars around the world are using an ideational conceptualization that draws heavily from earlier discursive theories. By employing the ideational approach, scholars have been able to provide empirical measures of populist discourse. In this article we explain and show the advantages of this ideational approach to a Latin American audience by presenting a new historical dataset measuring the discourse of Argentine, Chilean, and Peruvian presidents across the twentieth century. Our main intent is to clarify the ideational approach as well as to enliven the conceptual debate. While we are critical of alternative definitions, we acknowledge and reassess their theoretical insights.    Resumen    Aun cuando el estudio del populismo ha sido tradicionalmente un campo de los latinoamericanistas, la investigacion al respecto se ha vuelto cada vez mas comparativa. Uno de los beneficios mas importantes de los trabajos comparados es conceptual. En vez de definir al populismo en terminos estructurales, economicos o politico-estrategicos, un creciente numero de academicos alrededor del mundo utilizan una conceptualizacion ideacional vinculada con previas teorias discursivas. Mediante el uso del enfoque ideacional academicos han sido capaces de proveer mediciones empiricas de discurso populista. En este articulo explicamos y mostramos las ventajas del enfoque ideacional mediante la discusion de una nueva base de datos que mide el discurso de los presidentes de Argentina, Chile y Peru durante el siglo veinte. Nuestra principal intension es clarificar el enfoque ideacional y a su vez avivar el debate conceptual. Si bien es cierto que somos criticos de definiciones alternativas, reconocemos y reconsideramos sus aportes teoricos.},

The ideational definition of populism has three main parts: a Manichean and moral cosmology; the proclamation of 'the people' as a homogenous and virtuous community; and the depiction of 'the elite' as a corrupt and self-serving entity. Populism, elitism, and pluralism differ fundamentally from classical ideologies such as conservatism, liberalism, and socialism. The authors elaborate their theoretical framework, which brings in the notion of populist attitudes and their activation. They argue that populist attitudes function as a latent demand or a disposition. This is a common concept from the attitudinal and trait literature in psychology, which recognizes that many attitudes captured in survey instruments are not always fully expressed. The authors show the implications of the theory for measurement and method. The chapter also presents an overview of the key concepts discussed in this book.},

In contrast, contributors to this special issue draw from well-tested approaches to populism that allow them to build on previous work, especially work based on an ideational approach. In doing so, they highlight at least three things that a more scientific approach to populism can teach us. First, populism is not a new phenomenon, nor is the current wave necessarily stronger than previous ones; second, populist ideas exist at the level of individual voters and matter for political behavior; and third, populism has both positive and negative consequences for democracy. At the same time, contributions to this special issue allow us to highlight at least three limitations of the current ideational approach: it fails to comprehend other political ideas clearly and how they interact with populism; it lacks a theory about different modes of political organization pursued by populist forces; and it inadequately theorizes about the impact of populist forces on party systems.},

  abstract = {Since the late 1990s, when Latin American countries began making a "turn to the left," political parties and candidates on the right end of the partisan spectrum have had a difficult time achieving electoral success. Although the left turn can be seen as a natural reaction to the public's general dissatisfaction with the conservative modernization policies of the 1980s and 1990s, left-of-center politics are by no means permanent. In The Resilience of the Latin American Right, Juan Pablo Luna and Cristobal Rovira Kaltwasser seek to "right" this view by explaining the strategies conservative political parties have used to maintain a foothold in the region's electoral and governance processes. The editors provide an analytical framework for conceptualizing the right that works for both historic and contemporary politics, and the volume's contributors use the framework to evaluate right-of-center political activity across the continent. They find that conservative forces are pursuing a range of adaptive strategies, including nonelectroral and nonpartisan tactics. The book's four thematic sections include an analysis of parties and elections in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mexico, Peru, and Venezuela. Students and scholars of both Latin American politics and comparative politics will find The Resilience of the Latin American Right of vital interest.},

ABSTRACT   Objective. The aim of this paper is to analyze the health status of physical education students within the Community of Madrid (Spain).   Material and methods. The study was carried out at 25 secondary schools centers with the participation of 686 students in total. A non-probability sampling was selected and data were collected through questionnaires and observation sheets.   Results and discussion. The results of this study reveal that almost 50 \% of the students claim to have a chronic disease and vision problems are the most predominant. On the other hand, physical development is representative of the average population; cardiovascular adaptation of students isnot critical noralarming but should be better. In addition, school physical activity provides very little help as the assessment of the physical condition is inappropriate and sports facilities in public schools are clearly deficient from the point of view of health. Finally, teachers in all thecentreshad failed to collect these data before conducting this research, except some specific curricular adaptations requested by the students. Teachers need to seek new work methods that comply with health criteria and that are coordinated with health services.

  abstract = {Academics are increasingly using the concept of populism to make sense of current events such as the Brexit referendum and the Trump presidency. This is certainly a welcome development, but two shortcomings can be observed in the contemporary debate. On one hand, new populism scholars often start from scratch and do not build upon the existing research. On the other hand, those who have been doing comparative research on populism stay in their comfort zone and thus do not try to link their work to other academic fields. In this article, we address these two shortcomings by discussing some of the advantages of the so-called ideational approach to the comparative study of populism and by pointing out four avenues of future research, which are closely related to some of the contributions of this special issue, namely, (a) economic anxiety, (b) cultural backlash, (c) the tension between responsiveness and responsibility, and (d) (negative) partisanship and polarization.},

Gradually, SYRIZA -- a radical-leftist-turned-populist party -- rose to become the key electoral player under the aegis of its young and popular leader, Alexis Tsipras. SYRIZA eventually won two general elections in 2015 and ruled together with the populist radical right Independent Greeks (ANEL) as junior partner, a coalition of great analytical significance, representing the first ever governing alliance of left-wing and right-wing populist parties in Europe. This contribution investigates reactions to the SYRIZA-ANEL government, giving special emphasis to measures undertaken by domestic and external actors. A key finding that warrants further research is that, under the same conditions of economic crisis that bring populists to power, economic institutions and material constraints can play an imp...},

It is divided into two sections. The first part presents a historical analysis of the concept of populism, which demonstrates that it has been used to tackle a set of ambivalences immanent to all political order. The second part elaborates an ideal-typical definition of populism and offers a theoretical outline of this phenomenon.

Chile is also following this trend, but there are a number of particularities that make the Chilean case distinctive. After all, Chile is widely regarded as one of the most consolidated democratic regimes in Latin America and as having solid economic performance. However, citizens have shown decreasing levels of satisfaction with democracy and representative institutions, and are turning to protest and social mobilization to express their discontent. The paradox that Chile is facing today lies in the mismatch between the attitudes of voters and the overall performance of the regime. In explaining this intriguing puzzle, most of the literature has emphasized the legacy of institutional arrangements inherited from military rule. We argue that institutions are necessary but insufficient for explaining the increasing challenges that democratic representation faces. Thus, we also claim that it is necessary to consider not only the expansion of critical citizens and middle income earners, but also the repoliticization of inequalities.},
